// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = " You determine What are the business rules that need to be followed and what the data models are going to look like! "
const design = "This is where the 'sprint' happnens in the project and determines how long the devs will spend on it what work needs to be done, what feature set is being worked on."
const Implementation = " This is where you code the software and adjust where you need to to be able to adjust to change and make sure everything works "
const Testing = " You basically rinse and repeat steps 2-4 to make sure that the requirements fit and that the feature sets is built properly to move on and continue to refelct and make sure it all works and runs properly. Can take some serious time."
const Maintain = " The software is built and delivered and the customer and constant communication is used to make sure the program is runnin smoothly and efficiently"
